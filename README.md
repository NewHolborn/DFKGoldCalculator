# DFKGoldCalculator
A simple quest loot calculator for Defi Kingdoms

Well the story goes like this : I wanted to calculate how much gold my two fishermen are generating through quests in a week time period , 
and also I wanted to write some HARMONY related code so I started this small project.

Found an API (https://api.s0.t.hmny.io/) and from there I was able to get the balance of a wallet and also all the transactions related to DFK.
I am sorting only the "completedQuest" transactions and from the reciept of the transaction I get the loots that the quest generated.

I have provided the option to calculate the loot between two given dates , or the last 1,2,3 quests to have an idea of the daily gain.

Unfortunatelly I only have two fishermen so I could not expand loots for other quests (need to have the quests in my account for debuging)

If you like this project you can donate to fund the purchase of a forager in order to expand the loot search into foraging also :)
